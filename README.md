# IPPR-ProjectFKD
Design and implement a fake currency detection (FKD) system, and then test the system to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed techniques. The challenge of the project is that the system must be robust enough to identify different currencies.

Note from document:
1. In addition, a supporting document is to be produced to reflect on the methodologies and implementation tasks applied in the development of the application.
2. In terms of documentation, you are required to describe and justify the theoretical information about the image processing and computer vision algorithms used. 
3. To fulfil the objective of this coursework, you are also required to describe the results of testing using various test images. Pay particular attention in providing critical analysis for cases of images that fail.
4. This assignment is to be carried out as group work. Students will also be assessed individually on their contributions to the assignment.
5. Fake currency identification/detection must be done with atleast 3 types of features (one for every group member).
6. A GUI has to be developed, and the system must be updated to show the types of features towards fake detection.

Note:
1. GUI is a must
2. No deep learning
3. Different currency means same country different currency - $10, $50, $100 (not sure different country's currency is acceptable or not)
4. The system should be like: 1,Perform technique 2, Perform technique 3 Perform technique 4, based on the picture, image recognition and feature extraction, compare with real currency and decide whether it is authentic or not. 
5. final output must be integrated
6. Should come out with at least feature 1,2,3 - one student one feature
7. Include failure analysis as well
8. can make the fake currency by ourselves
